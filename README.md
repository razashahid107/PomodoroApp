# Timer App

The PomodoroApp is a simple Java application that allows users to set timers. I worked on this as my first Java project. This README provides an overview of PomodoroApp, along with instructions on how to run it after cloning the repository.

## Features

- Set a personalized countdown timer.

## Prerequisites

Before running the app, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Git (for cloning the repository)

## Running the app in Android Studio

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open Android Studio and select "Check out project from Version Control."
   - Choose "Git" and provide the repository URL: `https://github.com/razashahid107/PomodoroApp.git`
   - Click "Clone" to create a local copy of the repository.

2. **Import the Project:**
   - After cloning, import the project in Android Studio. Android Studio should detect the project.

3. **Build the Project:**
   - Once the project is open, Android Studio will automatically start building the project. This process may take a few moments, and you can monitor the progress in the "Build" window.

4. **Run the App:**
   - After the build is successful, you'll see a green "Play" button (with a triangle) in the toolbar or at the top-right corner of the window.
   - Click the "Play" button to run the app on the Android Emulator or a connected Android device.
   - Android Studio will prompt you to choose a device to run the app on. Select the desired device, and the app will be installed and launched on the selected device.

5. **Using PomodoroApp:**
   - The app will now be running on the emulator or connected device.
   - Use the app's interface to set the countdown time and start the timer.

6. **Stopping the App:**
   - To stop the app, you can click the "Stop" button in Android Studio, or you can stop the app directly from the emulator or connected device.

Please note that running Android apps in Android Studio requires having the Android SDK and appropriate emulator configurations set up. Get that set up from Android Studio's documentation.
